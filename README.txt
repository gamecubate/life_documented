Conway's Game of Life written for Impact and modified from the previous (life) version by adding trails that fade out over time.
Latest deployed version on http://www.gamecubate.com/playground/lifetrails.
I can be reached by email or via the Impact forums http://impactjs.com/forums/ (nickname "alexandre").
